## Compatibility

This project maintains a strong commitment to backward compatibility. No features or functionality are removed or substantially modified (other than bug fixes).

## Dependencies

This project does not attempt to track the latest version for each dependency. Reasons for updating a dependency include resolving a defect or security issue, or using a new library feature. _If it ain't broke, don't fix it._

## Pull Requests

Please discuss on our [mailing list](https://discourse.drone.io) before embarking on any significant pull request, otherwise you risk spending time working on something the developers might not want to merge into the project.

Pull requests should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits. For example, a pull request could add a feature, fix a bug, or format code; but not a mixture.

When you are ready to submit a pull request you can use the below checklist to to increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted in a timely manner:

- Run the unit tests.
- Format the code.
- Include entry in CHANGELOG.md that describes the change.
- Include unit tests when you contribute a new feature.
- Include unit tests when you contribute a bug fix to prevent regressions.
